                <div class='col-md-12'>My topic and this whole website is about how endangered sharks are, their death rates and why they are dying so quickly. I wanted to make a website on this topic for two reasons. First, I love sharks and even if you don't love them yourself, I wish more people would understand how many are dying and why. The other reason being this is a topic that I've made projects on before and had a lot of info to build off of.</div>
                <div class='col-md-12'>The big question I hope to answer is "How many Shakrs are really endangered?" This may seem like a dumb question but you'd be surprised how hard it is to find accurate info regarding Sharks specifically. The term "Shark" scientifically actually means a lot of different species that are related simply by having similar genitalia and reproductive methods, because of this species like Dogfish and even all species of rays are considered sharks and are often included in wide spread shark data. This can make it hard to really picture just how endangered actual sharks specifcally are.</div>

                <div class='col-md-6'>Sharks and their relatives (the skates, rays and chimaeras) have roamed the oceans for millennia. The evolutionary history of sharks stretches back for a staggering 440 million years, pre-dating the dinosaurs by about 200 million years and our own species by a great deal longer. Sharks have even survived five mass extinctions, including the 'Great Dying', an event that killed 90-96% of all species on earth.</div>
                <div class='col-md-6'>And yet in the present day we are seeing an unprecedented decline in shark populations. In just the past 50 years a miniscule fraction of their immense existence the global abundance of oceanic sharks and rays has plummeted by 71.1%. The number of sharks classified as endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species is climbing every year as new data shed light on their future. And the fact is, sharks are heading towards extinction. Fast.</div>
