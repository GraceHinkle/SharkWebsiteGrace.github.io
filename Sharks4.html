                    So why are so many sharks dying? Well, it's for many reasons, some being loss of habitat, accidental deaths from being caught in nets, and more. The biggest reasons for their decline is the consumption of them. The Shark meat and fin industry is worth 4.5 billion USD and is a lot more widespread than people think.
                    Below are world map graphs that I've gone through and altered in order to show the top 15 countries/territories involved in each category.

                    Above you can see which countries are engaged in the export and import of shark fins based on how many tons the import/export each year since 2013. The main use for shark fins is Shark Fin Soup, which is a traditional dish in eastern Asia, especially China, hence why most of the results are there. However, there are still some importers and exporters across the globe, including the US.

                    Above you can see which countries are engaged in the export and import of shark meat based on how many tons the import/export each year since 2013. Because of how controversial shark finning is, the hunting and trading of of overal shark meat is a lot less talked about, but still very important. Because of the shark meat trade being "undetected" to an extent, it not only allows for more sharks to be hunted without people noticing, but to much vaster areas aswell. As you can see shark meat is imported and exported much more widespread than shark fins, and unlike shark fins there are a lot fewer laws in place to regulate the hunting of sharks for their whole body.

                <div class='col-md-12'>
                    This along with the fact that the shark meat industry has been recently reported a spite in hunting and consumptionor for the use of a wider variety of things, some being that recently pet food companies have gotten in big trouble for replacing livestock meat with shark meat in dog food without changing the ingredient labels because shark meat is cheaper, shows concerning growth in the amount of sharks being hunted.

        <h2>Shark Reproductive Rates</h2>

                <div class='col-md-12'>
                    The other factor in the equation is whether sharks have the ability to reproduce fast enough to even grow back there population. The short answer to that is NO. Sharks have one of the longest gestation periods of any animal. It of course depends on species, but most sharks have a pregnancy of 1 year to a year and a half, and that's the average. Many larger species of sharks, which just so happen to be the ones most hunted, have gestation periods up to 2 years.

                <div class='col-md-12'>
                    Then ontop of that, most shark species take 20-25 years to reach maturity and the age to mate. Sharks also don't mate just willy nilly, but most species have very specific mating seasons.

                    With over 10 million sharks being killed each year by us, and many species not being able to even reach maturity before being killed, sharks are not equipped to bounce back there numbers on there own and their populations will only keep decreasing.
